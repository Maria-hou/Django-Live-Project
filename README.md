# Live Project
## Introduction
For two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked with a team of other students on a Django Python project to develop apps for an interactive website for managing one's collections of things related to various hobbies. Working in the Django framework and in a team setting was a great opportunity for learning version control, managing deadlines, and adding requested features. I saw how a good developer works with what they have and know to make a quality product. Within this two week sprint, I was given user stories of increasing difficulty to complete inorder to increase our problem solving mindest. I worked on several [back end stories](#back-end-stories) and front end stories of an application about destinations to visit in Los Angeles. Being a student there, I have always wanted to keep track of the places I have been. So, this was the perfect opportunity to incorporate something I am passionate about, into a project where I gained real world experience and improved my skills. 

Below are descriptions and examples of some of the stories that I worked on within my Los Angeles Destination App.
